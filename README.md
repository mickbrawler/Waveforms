Goal of this project:
=====================

A waveform needs to be embedded on a noisy data. 


Method:
=======

The script should do the following:

[] A Python function should be there to generate a sinusoidal function given
   a frequency, amplitude, start time, end time, attenuation function, and an
   initial phase.

[] A Python function should be there that will generate a noisy data for given
   duration. 

[] The second function should always create a data that has a duration longer 
   than the duration of the wave.

[] Reproducibility: The noise instance must be seeded, so that the exact same
   data (signal + noise) can be generated (if desired).
