Idea:
=====================

To perform analysis on statistics capable of detecting signals embedded in 
noise. 


Progress:
=======

[*] Simulated signal can be embedded in gaussian noise. Signal and noise
	characteristics are up to the user's inputs in function arguments.

[*] A match filter with multiple statistics can be performed on a waveform
	with multiple templates. 

[*] Simulated detectors can be used as a method of zeroing out the noise
	present in a waveform. With n detectors, n times as many match filters
	must be done

[*] Multiple methods of testing a statistics ability to distinguish the 
	presence and characteristics of a signal embedded in noise, given 
	different parameter sizes are available.

[*] (WIP) Use of Monte Carlo Markov Chains as a more efficient alternative 
	to the full grid based search for a signal's parameters. 

[*] (WIP) Use of bayesian statistics and kernel density estimation to produce
	confidences for neutron star equation of state models.
